To assign a **relevance score** to lab tests based on how well they match the query, we can use a **text-based matching technique** that compares different components of each lab test to the keywords in the query (in this case, "GLUCOSE IN BLOOD").

Here's a step-by-step technique you can use:

### 1. **Define Key Query Features**
   The query "GLUCOSE IN BLOOD" has two key components:
   - **Glucose** (the component of interest)
   - **Blood** (the system where the glucose is measured)

### 2. **Preprocess the Data**
   From the dataset, we extract relevant components for each test:
   - **component**: This is the actual substance being measured (e.g., Glucose, Bicarbonate).
   - **system**: This refers to where the measurement takes place (e.g., Blood, Serum/Plasma, Urine).

### 3. **Match Criteria**
   For each lab test, we'll compare the query to the fields `component` and `system` using the following approach:
   - **Exact Match**: If the `component` exactly matches the query term (e.g., "Glucose" matches "GLUCOSE"), it receives a higher score.
   - **Partial Match**: If a lab test contains a word or phrase similar to the query (e.g., "Glucose" in "Glucose in Urine"), we give it a lower score.
   - **System Match**: If the `system` matches "Blood" exactly (e.g., "Blood" in "Glucose [Moles/volume] in Blood"), we increase the score.

### 4. **Scoring Scheme**
   For each test, you can assign points as follows:
   - **Exact Match on `component`**: +3 points
   - **Partial Match on `component`**: +2 points (if it contains a synonym or closely related term)
   - **Exact Match on `system`**: +2 points
   - **Partial Match on `system`**: +1 point
   - **No Match**: 0 points

### 5. **Example Calculation**
   Let's calculate a relevance score for the first few entries based on the matching criteria:

   - **Query**: "GLUCOSE IN BLOOD"
   - **Test 1** (loinc_num: 1988-5): **C reactive protein [Mass/volume] in Serum or Plasma**
     - `component`: "C reactive protein" does not match "Glucose" → 0 points
     - `system`: "Serum or Plasma" does not match "Blood" → 0 points
     - **Score**: 0 points

   - **Test 2** (loinc_num: 1959-6): **Bicarbonate [Moles/volume] in Blood**
     - `component`: "Bicarbonate" does not match "Glucose" → 0 points
     - `system`: "Blood" matches → +2 points
     - **Score**: 2 points

   - **Test 3** (loinc_num: 15076-3): **Glucose [Moles/volume] in Urine**
     - `component`: "Glucose" matches → +3 points
     - `system`: "Urine" does not match "Blood" → 0 points
     - **Score**: 3 points

   - **Test 4** (loinc_num: 20565-8): **Carbon dioxide, total [Moles/volume] in Blood**
     - `component`: "Carbon dioxide" does not match "Glucose" → 0 points
     - `system`: "Blood" matches → +2 points
     - **Score**: 2 points

### 6. **Normalize the Scores**
   To ensure the scores are consistent and comparable, you can normalize them to a scale (e.g., from 0 to 10) by dividing by the highest possible score and multiplying by 10.

For example, if the highest possible score in your dataset is 5 (from an exact match on both component and system), then:
   - **Score** = \( \frac{2}{5} \times 10 = 4 \) (normalized score)

### Conclusion
By following this method, each test gets a score based on how well it matches the query. You can fine-tune the weights for exact and partial matches to optimize the relevance ranking for your specific application.
