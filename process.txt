Here's a structured way to approach this problem:  

### **1. Choose a Type of MLR Approach**  
You have three possible approaches to learning-to-rank (MLR):  
- **Pointwise:** Treats ranking as a regression or classification problem for individual documents.  
- **Pairwise:** Considers pairs of documents and learns which one should be ranked higher.  
- **Listwise:** Uses entire ranked lists of documents and optimizes for global ranking metrics.  

Your choice depends on the nature of your data and the final ranking quality you want.  
- **Pointwise** is simpler but may ignore relative rankings.  
- **Pairwise** balances ranking correctness without needing full list supervision.  
- **Listwise** is the most advanced but requires complete ground-truth rankings.  

### **2. Understand How It Works**  
Once you've chosen an approach, study its implementation details.  
- What kind of loss function does it use? (e.g., MSE for Pointwise, hinge loss for Pairwise, NDCG optimization for Listwise)  
- What are the input features? (e.g., term frequency, document length, BM25 scores, etc.)  
- How does it handle relevance labels?  

### **3. Map a Set of Real-World Lab Tests to LOINC (Independent Subtask)**  
- Identify the relevant **LOINC codes** for lab tests related to your queries:  
  - *Glucose in blood*  
  - *Bilirubin in plasma*  
  - *White blood cell count*  
- This involves using resources like the [LOINC database](https://loinc.org/) to find standard codes.  
- Ensure mappings are accurate and standardized to avoid ambiguity in document retrieval.  

### **4. Build the Training Set**  
Given the three queries and their associated documents:  
- **Feature Engineering:** Extract features for each document-query pair, such as:  
  - Term frequency (TF-IDF, BM25, embeddings)  
  - Metadata (document length, author, source)  
  - LOINC mappings (whether the document explicitly mentions the relevant test code)  
- **Relevance Labeling:** Assign relevance scores (e.g., scale of 0â€“3 or binary labels) to documents per query.  
- **Training Data Format:**  
  - **Pointwise:** Train a model with document-query pairs labeled independently.  
  - **Pairwise:** Convert the data into document pairs where one document is more relevant than another.  
  - **Listwise:** Rank entire sets of documents for each query and optimize using ranking metrics (e.g., NDCG).  

### **Next Steps**  
1. Pick your ranking method (Pointwise, Pairwise, or Listwise).  
2. Gather and preprocess your data, ensuring proper LOINC mappings.  
3. Extract document-query features.  
4. Assign relevance labels and format data accordingly.  
5. Train the model and evaluate using ranking metrics.
